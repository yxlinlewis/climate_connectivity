# Data preprocessing (patch_partition)

The codes for data preprocessing cannot be directly re-run to check because of the copyright issues of raw data. Users can try with their own data by editing the working directories and variables in scripts, where we left quite a lot of annotations to explain each part.


The `code_data_preprocessing` includes all raw data included in preprocessing.
